        // Note: Variable Lengths Arrays ARE supported by C99 but confusingly
        //       are NOT part of the C++11 Standard (ยง 8.3.4/1) nor are they in C14.
        // See the document: http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3820.html
        // If you have a broken compiler *without* C99 support you'll need to use alloca().
        // If you have a functioning compiler *with* C99 support it is safer to use:
        //     char set[ base ];

#if 1
        char *set = (char*) alloca( base ); // variable length array: set[ base ]
#else
        char set[ base ]; // variable length array
#endif
